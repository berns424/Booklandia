      <p>BOOKLANDIA Book Store is a leading Education Solutions Provider in the Philippines that aims to develop learners who excel in a complex, rapidly evolving, globally connected, highly technological, and environmentally fragile world and who contribute to its betterment. To achieve this goal, BOOKLANDIA provides a comprehensive suite of learning solutions to engage and enable communities, schools, teachers, parents, – and most importantly – Learners.</p>
      <p>It was along Azcarraga Street in Manila, now known as C.M. Recto, where two young and passionate individuals met. Their two establishments stood across each other: Jovita Buhain’s Rex Bookstore (which imported books) and Juanito Fontelera’s New Republic Book Store (which sold second-hand books). The two shared each other’s passion for books, wit, and commerce, which ultimately led to their marriage. This marked the beginning of BOOKLANDIA Book Store, Inc., which went on to publish Law books.“Legal Forms, Annotated” by Sulpicio Guevara was one of the first Law books produced by BOOKLANDIA Book Store, Inc. Unlike other form books published before, it was flexible and suitable for any given case or situation. It was written to guide law practitioners, students, and business executives on how to write different legal forms.</p>

      <p>The continuous growth and expansion of BOOKLANDIA Book Store was very evident in the 1990s. Led by the 3rd generation of the family, spearheaded by its Chief Operating Officer Don Timothy Buhain and eventually followed by Director for Publishing Danda Buhain-Garcia, the company expanded, not only in business but also with the advocacies they supported. In 1994, the Rex Oasis of Arts and Culture Foundation was formed. This time around, the people behind Rex Book Store advocated the preservation of Filipino cultural heritage and support for artistically gifted Filipinos. With a global culture emerging, this would be the only way that Filipinos could offer something truly unique to the world.</p>
      <p>In the 21st century, the Philippines, like the rest of the world, was thrown into globalization. BOOKLANDIA Book Store entered the digital age with the presence of Rex Interactive and Rex Publishing online. To also adapt to the global landscape, Rex Book Store International was incorporated in 2005 to respond to international business ventures. BOOKLANDIA Book Store became the sole distributor of Teacher Created Materials — a trusted resource from kinder to Grade 12 educators in over 92 countries. Diversified titles from different product lines were also produced at the start of the 21st century. In this decade, Roger John Fontelera and Jeanne Marie Fontelera-Tordesillas joined Rex Book Store to head Finance and Marketing, respectively.</p>

      <p>In light of technological advances and the prevalent use of the Internet, Rex Digital was established in 2012. Rex Digital enhances student learning by providing better engagement, stronger collaboration, simplified instruction, and unified communication between educators and students. Three years later, in 2015, the Resource for Educators and Academic Professionals (REAP) was launched. As a center for learning, REAP provides educator trainings and has a training center that can be rented by the public. A year later, in 2016, the Rex Institute for Student Excellence (RISE) was established to assist educational institutions and teachers in using assessment and research toward the achievement of students’ learning goals.</p>
